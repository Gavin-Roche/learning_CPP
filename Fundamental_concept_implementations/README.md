# Fundamental Concept Implementations
This folder contains slightly larger test programs that explore basic programming concepts. While still simple, they offer more functionality than the smallest exercises in [Basic_concepts_projects](../Basic_concepts_projects/) and [Basic_projects](../Basic_projects/). Some of these programs were developed in a classroom setting, while others were written independently. For example, [Calculate_days_between_dates.cpp](./Calculate_days_between_dates.cpp) was written to calculate the number of days between dates as part of a competition challenge.
